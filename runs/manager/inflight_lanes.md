# In-flight lanes (write at session end, read at session start — FABLE_OPERATING_MANUAL §14 step 9)

One row per still-running lane so the next session neither double-dispatches nor loses a resume.

WAVE 4 OPEN 2026-07-07 (manager session on branch `worktree-wave4-manager`; boot prompt
`runs/manager/wave4_boot_prompt.md`). All lanes dispatched ~2026-07-07 as background codex exec per
manual §10; resume = `cd /Users/arnavchokshi/Desktop/pickleball && codex exec resume -c
model_reasoning_effort=<effort> <SESSION_ID> -` (session id in report.json, or `grep "session id"
runs/lanes/<lane>/log.txt`); harness bg-task ids listed for TaskOutput monitoring.

| lane | kind (codex/sonnet/workflow) | session/task id | resume command | owned files | vm (if any) | expected done | dispatched |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~w4_cammotion_diag_20260707~~ RULED PASS: root cause = OpenCV decode-orientation context mismatch (portrait img1605 raw-landscape decode collapses features 217→14 → probe 0.33-0.42 vs 53.7 orientation-applied); deterministic repro + --assert-fixed defect proof banked; frame-window/fps/normalization hypotheses refuted | codex DONE | broazt3p3 | — | — | — | done | 2026-07-07 |

| ~~w4_footattr_fix_20260707~~ PARTIAL-per-fence ACCEPTED (uncommitted — held for verify round): all 7 achievable acceptances PASS — defect proof green unmodified; counts EXACTLY match Design A (127/186/33/10) w/ refine kill=false 4/4; offline slide 20.25/22.50/17.98/16.66mm (= w3 GPU values); phaseverify green ×2; 268/0. Fenced process_video stage insertion = deferred patch for integration lane.

| ~~w4_footattr_verify_20260707~~ VERDICT: DEFECTS-FOUND ×5: (1) circularity CONFIRMED — patch wires gate-stream transform not skeleton builder (exact-match solved); (2) fabricated confidence — contradictory row certifies @1.0, crossover dual-confident; (3) FORBIDDEN gate-threshold exclusion reintroduced (r2 class, standing-rule violation); (4) deferred patch invalid ("garbage at line 4"; hand-applied copy proved stage order works, refine engages); (5) w3 banked artifacts overwritten w/o backup (originals reconstructible — Wolverine orig 18 src phases vs regen 39 = new population) + new tests vacuous (mutant passes 7/7).

D.3(b) 0/5 EXACT intervals — re-segmented not demoted; replacements claim lower endpoint error; Burlington [497,543] baseline-perfect SPLIT. Re-ruling (exact-identity vs span-equivalence) HELD for adversarial adjudication (unfailable-acceptance risk: missing_exact_interval could mask demotions) | codex DONE (r1) | bk3kmgnv1 | resume via log session id | ball_arc_solver.py + test (working-tree, uncommitted) | — | verify pending | 2026-07-07 |

FOREIGN LANE (dispatched by the Fable-final/succession session, noted uncommitted on the MAIN
tree's copy of this board — preserve at merge): p63_reference_ranges_20260707 | codex | owned:
ONLY NEW FILES docs/racketsport/reference_ranges_{schema,v0}.json,
scripts/racketsport/validate_reference_ranges.py, tests/racketsport/test_reference_ranges.py
(+scaffold-index line — shared touchpoint with w4_fleethosts/w4_ballcode/w4_court_harvestcal
registrations; check at adjudication) | ~1-2h from 2026-07-07.

CONCURRENT-SESSION UPDATE: brand-v2 (wave-2 manager) session COMPLETED its arc — ios work
committed+pushed by it; its final docs bullet (c657a25c0) rode along with my 684d03380 push.
ios/** stays untouched by wave-4 regardless.

QUEUED (not yet dispatched): w4_ballgpu (Sonnet GPU H100 spot, AFTER w4_ballcode rules PASS — WASB
prestage sha-check + seed fine-tune on owner labels + SST r1 (teacher = 40 local raw-WASB sidecars)
+ threshold sweep, ALL scoring through the SCORING BRIDGE on Burlington/Wolverine, INTERNAL-VAL
ONLY, self-provision→run→verify→DELETE); w4_cammotion_fix + w4_footattr_fix (AFTER diagnosis
rulings; each ships with one adversarial-verify round — gate-adjacent); w4_h100body (conditional,
queue #7); wave-close sequence: integration micro-lane (if needed) → ONE wide-suite adjudication
(minus test_court_finding_technology_benchmark.py, standalone) → fresh-GPU 4-clip proof
(snapshot→fan, A100 proven SKU, version-stamp first, browser-verify replay_viewer_manifest.json) →
docs reconciliation (W4-F) → [WAVE-4 COMPLETE] bullet + wave-5 boot prompt.

Fleet at open: fleet1 STOPPED disk-intact (only VM, list-confirmed; impersonated-call auth OK
2026-07-07). No VM running. GPU budget stated in boot prompt: ~$12-25 expected.

Concurrent-session fence: ios/** + BUILD_CHECKLIST bullet 710 + working-tree ios changes belong to
the wave-2 manager session (brand-v2 verify leg) — never touched by wave-4 lanes or commits.
